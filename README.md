# An Alignment-based Approach for Calculating PARSEVAL Measures

This github repo provides the following: 

1. a python notebook featuring Penn Treebank examples (Section 01, copied from `nltk_data` â€” refer to `Installing NLTK Data` at https://www.nltk.org/data.html) demonstrating the process of end-to-end testing (from raw text to constituency parsing)

2. a python notebook containing examples of sentence and word mismatches 

3. a pyhton notebook containing failed cases from the evalb tool (copied from the latest version of `EVALB.tgz` at https://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/), where the current proposed method successfully evaluates them.
